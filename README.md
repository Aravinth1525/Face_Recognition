### Face Recognition Model 

Siamese Neural Networks for Facial Recognition-Based ID Verification. Our system harnesses the power of cutting-edge Siamese neural networks to revolutionize identity verification. By leveraging facial recognition technology, we have developed a highly accurate and efficient system for verifying both the student and the ID card. Our neural network is trained to analyze and compare facial features, enabling us to quickly and confidently confirm a match.
